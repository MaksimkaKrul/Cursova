LOST - is a web text-rpg game, you can play that you can play now!
The homepage, local registration and logging, character creation and a little bit of gameplay basis are already ready.
As it is written in the site itself - the inspirations are DoL and Lilith throne, so I assume the gameplay is about the same, with its own changes. There will be movement on a small map (step by step), skirmishes and battles, and of course 18+ content.
POTENTIALLY possible to launch patreon or similar platform, where it will be possible to release updates, for example, a week earlier than for all others.

To run the site - just run server.js.
After that on it you can change some settings, read the description, etc., that to start the game, you must first register, so we start with it by clicking on the register button. Then go to the newly created account and we are sent to the main page. After that we can enter the name of the save-file and choose what customization we want.

After choosing everything we want for the character, we are sent to the game page, where we can click on the character button and see everything we have chosen.
On the same site we can already see how the gameplay will take place, there will be choices and depending on them to go time, so then will be added a scale of fatigue that the player would have a reason to go to sleep.
